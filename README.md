Welcome to KRISHI-CREW, a project aimed at revolutionizing agriculture in Jammu and Kashmir. This project was curated for the Government of Jammu and Kashmir and presented in Smart India Hackathon. Our mission is to empower farmers with advanced agricultural insights, connect them with global markets, and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Project Overview
KRISHI-CREW focuses on several key objectives:

### Predictive Models:
We developed models to predict the most suitable crops based on soil type, climate conditions, and other relevant factors specific to Jammu and Kashmir.

### Government Initiatives:
We raise awareness among farmers about government initiatives and programs that can benefit them, fostering growth and sustainability in agriculture.

### Market Connectivity:
By bridging the gap between farmers and buyers, KRISHI-CREW opens doors to a larger global market, enhancing economic opportunities for farmers in Jammu and Kashmir.

## Key Features
### Crop Suitability Prediction:
Our predictive models analyze soil quality, climate data, and geographical conditions to recommend the best crops for cultivation in different regions of Jammu and Kashmir.

### Government Initiatives Awareness:
Detailed information on government schemes, subsidies, and support programs aimed at benefiting farmers in the region.

### Marketplace Integration:
Platform features that facilitate direct connections between farmers and potential buyers, enabling efficient trade and market access.
